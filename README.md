Samehadaku.tv is a free anime (with Indonesian subtitle) provider. But, Samehadaku.tv does a painful download process. That is caused by the implementation of ads and link shorteners. Smhdk is an ad-free Samehadaku.tv downloader tool which removes the hassles when downloading an anime from Samehadaku.tv and thus makes the downloading process easier.
